            <h1 class="article-title">What is QA in Software Testing?</h1>
                <p>
                    In the past, quality assurance testing has generally been brought into process relatively late 
                    in the development cycle. For example, in Waterfall, the software is produced and passed 
                    along to the QA team, who offer feedback, then send the software back to development 
                    so they can fix the problems.
                <br>
                
                    In an Agile environment, everyone, including the Quality Assurance Team, works collaboratively 
                    to make improvements on an ongoing basis. Yet, as developers, operators, and testers embrace 
                    a shared responsibility for making sure they deliver a high-quality end product, 
                    QA often struggles to find its place.
                
                <br>
                    Automated software testing adds another layer of complexity to the mix, which brings up 
                    an important question: what is quality assurance (QA) testing and how does it fit into 
                    today’s fast-paced development process?
                </p>

            <h1 class="article-title">What Is Quality Assurance Testing?</h1>
                <p>
                    Quality assurance testing is quality assurance(QA) or a quality testing process that ensures that 
                    an organization delivers the best products or services possible.
               <br>
                    QA aims to deliver consistent results through a set of standardized procedures, which means that 
                    organizations also need to make sure that their processes for achieving the desired 
                    results hit specific quality benchmarks themselves.
               <br>
                    In brief, you might say that QA includes all activities that center around implementing standards 
                    and procedures associated with ensuring that software meets a certain set of requirements before 
                    it’s released to the public.
                <br>
                    The key thing to keep in mind is that QA doesn’t involve the actual testing of products. Instead,
                    it focuses on the procedures to ensure the best outcome. QA activities are ultimately 
                    process oriented.
